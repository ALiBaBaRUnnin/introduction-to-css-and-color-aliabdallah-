                    <h2>My Journey into Web Development</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I'm Ali Abdallah, and I've been passionate about technology and problem-solving for as long as I can remember. My journey into web development began in 2022 when I decided to explore coding more seriously. I'm currently studying at Marywood University, where I'm building a solid foundation in programming languages, web technologies, and development tools. I enjoy developing both front-end and back-end solutions and am always eager to learn new techniques and improve my skills.</p>

                    <h2>Education and Career Path</h2>
                    <p>Since my high school graduation in 2020, I've been committed to expanding my knowledge of the tech world. In addition to my academic studies, I’ve been pursuing practical projects like developing interactive websites, games, and exploring different technologies, such as Unity for game development and C++ for low-level programming. I aim to combine my love for coding with my desire to create real-world applications that are both functional and enjoyable to use.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me unwind and stay motivated. I'm an avid driver, and I find it therapeutic to take my BMW out on the road, especially when I need time to think or reflect. When I’m not coding or driving, I spend time learning about the stock market and trading assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, trying to apply my analytical skills to the financial world. I also have a strong interest in character development in games, which ties into my Capstone project where I’m creating an interactive adventure game.</p>

                    <h2>Personal Growth and Future Goals</h2>
                    <p>For me, personal growth is a continuous journey. Whether it’s learning a new programming language, improving my stock trading strategy, or gaining insight from my experiences with family and friends, I’m always looking for ways to better myself. I plan to continue developing my skills in web and game development while staying curious about new technologies and ways to improve my craft. My goal is to build a career where I can make a positive impact, whether through my own projects or by collaborating with others who share my passion for innovation and technology.</p>
